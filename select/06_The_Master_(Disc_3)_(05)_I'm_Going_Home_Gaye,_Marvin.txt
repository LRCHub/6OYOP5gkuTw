I'm going home, to see my mother
I'm going home, to see my dear old dad
I'm going home, to be with my sister
I'm going home, won't my brother be glad?

Going home, yeah
Gonna look out the window
I'm going home
To see what I saw in the past
I'm going home
Where somebody love me
I'm going home
Though I might be in rags

Been so long since, I began to roam
Never should have left home
Thought I was grown
But now I see what it meant to me

I'm going home, see my mother
I'm going home, to be with dear old dad
I'm going home (ooh), to be with my sister
I'm going home yeah, won't my brother be glad?

Going home
Look out the window
Going home
Do I see what I saw in the past?
I'm going home
Where somebody love me
Going home
Won't my mama be glad?

Ah, it's been so long since I began to roam
Thought I could make it on my own
All I wanna do is go home

Going home, see you mama
Going home, this whole world's treated me bad
Comin' home, daddy, put your arm around you
Going home, ah, I won't be sad

Going home, I've cried these teardrops
I'm going home, I don't know where to roam
Going home, I, I need
Going home, won't I, won't I be glad?

I'm going home, where the sunshine is
Going home, there are no clouds of gray
Going home, to see my old buddy
Going home, to shake my friends' hands today

Whoa it's been so long
Since I began to roam
Thought I could make it on my own
But I now see, gotta go back

Going home, see my mother
Going home, to be with my dear old dad
Going home, to see my sisters
Going home, won't my brother be glad?

Going home, see my mother
Going home, to kiss my dear old dad, woo
Going home, to see my sister, yeah
Going home, won't my brother be glad?

Ahh yeah, yeah, ah yeh
Going home
Going home
Going home
Going home
Going home
Going home
